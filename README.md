# Automatics-Redialing

In this code, we can automatically redial at particaular number continously by using GSM based system. The call rings for some 
seconds then automatically disconnect and then redial to the same number till the time we stop the embedded system.

To run the code do the following steps: 
1.> Download eclipse for embedded C and make project and copy paste the code to the project. 
2.> Compile the code. 
3.> Upload the code to microcontroller using AVR debugger.
